# computational-sound-lab-2
synth!

This project was made for COMS3430 - Computational Sound. Implemented with Web Audio API, it is a digital synthesier! The user can play notes by pressing letters and numbers on the keyboard (see main.js for mapping). Modify how the notes sound by adding partials, FM, or AM synthesis or a low frequency oscillator.
The visuals were implemented in p5.js. Play for long enough to reveal a surprise!
